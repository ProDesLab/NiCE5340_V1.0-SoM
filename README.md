## What is NiCE5340 ?
NiCE5340 SoM is the combination of the capabilities of two devices: a microcontroller and an FPGA.
In this case, it is a Nordic **nRF5340** MCU and a Lattice **iCE40** FPGA. From the fusion of these two names comes the NiCE5340.
NiCE5340 is a deliberate practice project to improve my design skills.
